# Neighborhood Map: wineries in Madrid.

This is the last project for the Udacity's front-end web development nanodegree.

The main goal of this project is to learn about design patterns using a framework, in this case [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/index.html),and using third-party APIs (Google maps and Foursquare).

I'm using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to bundle the HTMl CSS and JavaScript code.
For styling the peoject I decided to use flexbox and css custom properties. I'm using babel to transpile JavaScript.

### Installation

To view this project you can clone this repository on your computer and run the the command `npm install` in the project root. I'm using node v8.9.4. Then you have to install [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html).

To install it with Yarn run `yarn global add parcel-bundler`.

To install it with npm run `npm install -g parcel-bundler`.
After run the command `npm start`.

The application can be found at `http://localhost:1234`.
