This is the last project for the Udacity's front-end web development nanodegree.

The main goal of this project is to learn about design patterns using a framework, in this case [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/index.html),and using third-party APIs (Google maps and Foursquare).

I'm using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to bundle the HTMl CSS and JavaScript code.
For styling the peoject I decided to use flexbox and css custom properties. I'm using babel to transpile JavaScript.

To view this project you can clone this repository on your computer and run the the command `npm install` in the project root. After installing all package dependencies and [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html), run the command `parcel index.html`. The application can be found at `http://localhost:1234`.
