# Neighborhood Map: wineries in Spain.

This is the last project for Udacity's front-end web development nanodegree.

The main goal of this project is to learn about design patterns using a framework, in this case [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/index.html), and third-party APIs (Google maps and Foursquare).

### Installation

To view this project you can clone this repository on your computer and open the `index.html` in the root directory in your favorite browser.

### Credits
- [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)

I used the pages of Spain and Madrid tourism for reference about the winery routes.
